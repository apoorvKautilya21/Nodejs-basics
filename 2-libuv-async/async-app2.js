//  setTimeout is an asynchronous function, meaning it doesn't block the execution of the code. When you call setTimeout , the callback function is passed to Libuv ÓÇÅNode.js's underlying library), which manages asynchronous operations.
// The callback function from setTimeout(0) is added to the event queue. However, it won't be executed until the current call stack is empty. This means that even if you specify a 0-millisecond delay, the callback will only execute after the global execution context is done.
